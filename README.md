# Image Classification using CNN on CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project aims to classify images into 10 different classes using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The dataset used for this project is the [CIFAR-10 dataset], which contains 60,000 color images of size 32x32 pixels, divided into 10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

## Installation and Usage

To run this project, you will need the following libraries:

- tensorflow
- keras
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn

You can install them using pip:

```
To run the project, you can use the following command:

1. After installing the dependencies, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-Talha4k/Image-Classification-CNN-CIFAR10.git

This notebook contain the code and explanation of the task.

## Results

The CNN model achieved an accuracy of 88%, a precision of 0.88, a recall of 0.89, and an F1-score of 0.88 on the test set. The model was able to classify most of the images correctly, but it also had some misclassifications. The confusion matrix shows that the model had the most difficulty in distinguishing between cats and dogs.
